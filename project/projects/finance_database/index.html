        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>
            This project was all about working with financial data.  Think of it like organizing a giant library of information about money!  We learned how to collect, organize, and make sense of all sorts of financial data.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was a bit like solving a puzzle, where we had to find the right pieces of information and put them together to see the bigger picture.
