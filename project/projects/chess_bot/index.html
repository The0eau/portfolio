        <p>This project focuses on modeling a chess game using game theory and deep learning techniques. The goal was to build an AI-powered chess bot that could play optimally by simulating the decision-making process of a human player. The project was implemented using object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python.</p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Game Theory and Deep Learning:</strong> Utilized game theory concepts to model the chess game and trained the bot using deep learning techniques to make strategic decisions.</li>
            <li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</strong> Applied object-oriented programming principles in Python to design and structure the chess game, ensuring modularity, scalability, and ease of maintenance.</li>
            <li><strong>Chess Bot:</strong> Developed a fully functional chess bot capable of playing chess against users, making optimal moves based on the analysis of the current game state.</li>
