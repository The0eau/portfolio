        <h2>What's It All About?</h2>
        <p>
            Have you ever wondered what it's like to be in charge of a company?  This project was like playing a super cool game where we got to run a business with 50 employees! We made all the big decisions, from what projects to work on to how to keep everyone happy and productive.
        </p>
        <p>
            Think of it like being the captain of a team. You need to make sure everyone knows what they're doing, that they have the tools they need, and that they're working together well.  That's what this simulation was all about!

                <li><strong>Manage People:</strong> We learned how to communicate with our employees, motivate them, and help them do their best work.</li>
                <li><strong>Solve Problems:</strong> Just like in real life, things didn't always go smoothly. We had to figure out how to overcome challenges and keep the business running.</li>
            </ul>
