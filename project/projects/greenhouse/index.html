    <section id="intro">
        <p>This project involved designing and implementing an autonomous greenhouse system that monitors and optimizes environmental factors for plant growth using IoT and automation technologies. The goal was to create a fully self-sustaining system that ensures optimal conditions for plants, reduces human intervention, and increases efficiency in farming practices.</p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>IoT Integration:</strong> Integrated IoT devices such as temperature sensors, humidity controllers, and automated irrigation systems to monitor and control the greenhouse environment in real-time.</li>
            <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Developed automated systems for irrigation, lighting, and ventilation based on real-time data, ensuring consistent plant growth conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental Monitoring:</strong> Utilized sensors to measure key factors such as soil moisture, temperature, and light intensity, adjusting the environment to optimize plant health and growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Collected and analyzed data to improve system efficiency and predict optimal conditions for various types of plants.</li>
        </ul>
