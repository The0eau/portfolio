        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Preparation and Analysis:</strong> Collected and cleaned datasets containing both phishing and legitimate links, followed by preprocessing for analysis and feature extraction.</li>
            <li><strong>Comparison of Supervised Models:</strong> Evaluated and compared several supervised machine learning models to identify the most effective one for phishing link detection.</li>
            <li><strong>Models Used:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Decision Trees</li>
                    <li>Ensemble Methods</li>
                    <li>Neural Networks</li>
                    <li>Support Vector Machines</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Model Evaluation:</strong> Analyzed the performance of each model in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall, identifying the best model for detecting phishing links.</li>
            <li><strong>Interpretation & Report:</strong> Interpreted the results and created a detailed report summarizing the findings, including the best model's effectiveness in detecting phishing links.</li>
        </ul>
