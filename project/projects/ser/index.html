        <h1>Optimization of a Logistics Network</h1>
    </header>

    <section id="intro">
        <p>This project demonstrates my ability to solve optimization problems, a key skill for finance applications such as portfolio allocation and risk management. The focus of this project was on optimizing a logistics network using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), with tools such as Python (Pandas, Numpy, PULP) to model and solve the problem efficiently.</p>
