        <h1>Project FPA: Autonomous Robot Creation for Competition Using RFID Technology</h1>
    </header>

    <section id="intro">
        <p>This project, part of an autonomous robot competition, involved developing a robot capable of interacting with its environment via RFID technology. The robot had to detect and react to RFID tags placed along its path while optimizing its autonomous navigation performance. The system was designed to operate fully autonomously without human intervention, with the goal of maximizing the robot's efficiency and speed on a predefined course.</p>
