        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Deep Learning: Neural Networks:</strong> Utilized deep learning techniques, particularly neural networks, to enable the bot to learn from vast amounts of text data and improve response generation.</li>
            <li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> Applied NLP techniques in Python to process and understand human language, allowing the bot to interpret user queries and provide meaningful responses.</li>
            <li><strong>Chat Bot:</strong> Developed a fully functional chat bot capable of conversing with users, providing helpful answers and engaging in dynamic, context-aware conversations.</li>
        </ul>
