    <p>5 weeks, 3-5 hours per week</p>

<p>I have completed the "Foundations of Finance" online course offered by the University of Cambridge. The course provided a strong foundation in key financial concepts, including money and capital, cash flow forecasting, financial reporting, interest and return, and risk management.</p>

<p><strong>Key concepts covered include:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Money and capital in the financial system.</li>
  <li>Cash flows and techniques for cash flow forecasting.</li>
  <li>Financial reporting and analysis of financial statements.</li>
  <li>Understanding interest, return, and their impact on financial decisions.</li>
  <li>Risk and risk management strategies in finance.</li>
</ul>

<p>This course provided me with essential knowledge of finance, preparing me to apply these concepts in real-world financial analysis and decision-making.</p>
