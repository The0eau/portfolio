    <h1>Harvard Online Courses in Data Science – "Introduction to Data Science with Python"</h1>

    <p>8 weeks, 4 hours per week</p>

    <p>I have completed this online course offered by Harvard, which provided hands-on experience in using Python to tackle real-world data science challenges. The course focused on practicing Python programming for modeling, statistics, and data storytelling. It also included the use of popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and SKLearn.</p>

    <p><strong>Key concepts covered include:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Python programming for data modeling, statistics, and storytelling.</li>
    <li>Utilizing libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and SKLearn.</li>
    <li>Running basic machine learning models using Python and evaluating their performance.</li>
    <li>Applying machine learning models to real-world problems.</li>
    <li>Building a foundation for Python use in machine learning and artificial intelligence.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This course helped me build a strong foundation in Python for data science and prepared me for future studies in machine learning and AI.</p>
