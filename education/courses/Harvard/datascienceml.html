    <h1>Harvard Online Courses in Data Science – "Data Science Machine Learning"</h1>
    <p>8 weeks, 4 hours per week</p>
    
    <p>I have completed this online course offered by Harvard, which introduced me to the fundamentals of machine learning. During the course, I learned how to perform cross-validation to avoid overfitting models and explored several popular machine learning algorithms. I also gained hands-on experience in building a recommendation system.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Key concepts covered include:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The basics of machine learning.</li>
      <li>Cross-validation techniques to prevent overfitting.</li>
      <li>An introduction to popular algorithms such as random forests and support vector machines (SVM).</li>
      <li>How to build a recommendation system.</li>
      <li>Regularization, an essential concept for improving model performance and preventing overfitting.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This course provided me with a solid foundation in machine learning, and I now feel well-prepared to apply these principles in real-world projects and pursue further studies in the field.</p>
