    <h1>IBM Course – "Mastering Generative AI: Model Foundations and NLP"</h1>

    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 2 weeks, 2 to 3 hours per week</p>

    <p>I have completed the "Mastering Generative AI: Model Foundations and NLP" course offered by IBM. This course served as an introduction to understanding language in the context of generative AI. It covered the fundamentals of natural language processing (NLP) and AI model development, focusing on linguistic models such as N-grams, word2vec, and sequence-to-sequence models.</p>

    <p><strong>Key concepts covered include:</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>The foundations of natural language processing (NLP) and generative AI.</li>
    <li>Understanding different linguistic models and neural networks, including N-grams, word2vec, and sequence-to-sequence models.</li>
    <li>Evaluation metrics for assessing the quality of generated text.</li>
    <li>Building and training a simple language model, integrating word2vec, and developing a sequence-to-sequence model.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This course is part of the professional certificate in generative AI engineering, providing essential skills in Python, PyTorch, and neural networks applied to large language models (LLMs).</p>
